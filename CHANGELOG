                                        -----           ADDED           -----
- Added: Changelog
- Added: 4 New Headers
    - Win_Util.h
        - This contains code that is only usable buy devices running Windows OS and colors some of the outputs for
          the game.
    - Comp_Util.h
        - This contains a more compatible variant of Win_Util.h all should be able to run this version of the output
          functions.
    - CSweeper.h
        - This contains the bulk of the code that used to be contained all in main.cpp
          (Necessary? Idk, may revert as I don't know if this is the proper use of Header files, but using a Source Code
          file did not work when I changed it)
    - debug.h
        - This contains all the functions that may or may not be used by CSweeper.h
- Added: "#if _WIN32 || _WIN64" statement to check if the user is using a Windows OS or not to choose the required header
         and some other misc cases.
- Added: Function Prototypes in CSweeper.h to better sort the functions.


                                        -----           CHANGES         -----
- Changed: main.cpp no longer contains all the code is has been shifted between all headers.
        R: Seemed to be a good idea may not be super useful in future.
- Changed: ordering of the functions as to see the order of use more clearly.
        R: Felt uncomfortable to find sections of code.
- Changed: 'Playing' Class with just global variables.
        R: Just needed to remain static for use.
- Changed: Headers and Source Files, because we actually figured out how they are supposed to work.
                                        -----           REMOVED         -----
- The multiple Scan() loops (what was Scan1 and Scan2)
- [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED] The removal of the playing() function.
