This code was a passion project created for COP 2006 - Programming 1 and updated further for COP 3003 - Programming 2. It may not be updated super frequently, if at all. It was made to run on CLion originally but should work with any IDE that handles C++. It should if properly initialized, work imediately. The code should only ask you for inputs of a X and Y location on the grid and then outputs the updated grid for that turn, each turn until completion. A score will be given then recorded in a file, the code will end after choosing to end the game after prompted. Please refer to Security.md if any issues occur or anything I may have missed is found in the code. Thank you for viewing this repository.
